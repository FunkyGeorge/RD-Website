			<p class="flow-text">Bulding an app is like building a house, it all starts with a blueprint. We'll discuss your vision and develop a wireframe.  That way we can both see what will be built before we start the fun part.</p>
			<p class="flow-text">After the wireframe is approved we start building.  We will meet once a week to discuss what has been completed and what will be completed in the next week that way you are informed and have oversight throughout the process.</p>
			<p class="flow-text">Last, we will test your application before it is ready to ship!  Let's start wireframing by getting in touch with us on your right.</p>
